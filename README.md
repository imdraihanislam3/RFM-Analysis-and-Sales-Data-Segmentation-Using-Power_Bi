## 🚀 Insights & Sugested Actions

-- A small group of high-value customers (Champions & Loyal Customers) generates a disproportionate share of revenue.

Suggested Action:  Prioritize retention through loyalty programs, exclusive offers, and personalized engagement.

-- A growing “At Risk” customer segment indicates potential revenue loss due to churn.

Suggested Action:  Launch targeted win-back and re-engagement campaigns to retain these customers before churn.

-- Revenue fluctuations are primarily driven by changes in active customer volume rather than spending per customer.

Suggested Action:  Strengthen customer acquisition and activation strategies during low-performance periods.
